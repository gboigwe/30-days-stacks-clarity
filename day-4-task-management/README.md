# Day 4: Advanced Integration - Multi-User Task Management

This project implements a sophisticated multi-user task management system with advanced Stacks.js integration patterns, representing Day 4 of the "30 Days of Stacks & Clarity" tutorial series.

## Features

### Smart Contracts
- **Multi-User Task Management**: Create, assign, and complete tasks with multiple users
- **Advanced Permission Systems**: Creator vs assignee rights and access control
- **Escrow System**: STX rewards held in escrow until task completion
- **Reputation Tracking**: User reputation based on task completion and community activity
- **User Profiles**: Extended profiles with skills, badges, and statistics
- **Task Categories**: Organized task system with filtering capabilities

### Frontend Application
- **Task Ecosystem Dashboard**: Tabbed interface for managing all task activities
- **Real-Time Updates**: Auto-refresh community activity and task status
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback with blockchain confirmation
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Find tasks by category, difficulty, and reward
- **Community Features**: Activity feeds, user profiles, and leaderboards
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for all screen sizes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Clarinet 2.0+
- Stacks wallet with testnet STX

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and setup contracts
cd day-4-task-management
clarinet check

# Setup frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

```bash
# Check contracts
clarinet check

# Test contracts
clarinet test

# Deploy to devnet
clarinet integrate
```

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

**task-manager.clar**
- Multi-user task creation with comprehensive metadata
- Task assignment and completion workflows
- STX reward escrow and release system
- Community statistics and leaderboards

**user-profiles.clar**
- Extended user profile management
- Reputation system with skill tracking
- Social features and badge system
- Privacy controls and connections

### Frontend Architecture

**Advanced Hooks**
- `useTaskEcosystem`: Multi-user data management with parallel loading
- `useOptimisticTaskManager`: Immediate UI updates with revert capabilities
- `useAdvancedTransactions`: Complex transaction monitoring and retry logic
- `useUserProfiles`: User profile and reputation management

**Key Components**
- `TaskEcosystemDashboard`: Main interface with real-time updates
- `TaskCard`: Interactive task display with application system
- `CreateTaskForm`: Advanced task creation with validation
- `UserProfileCard`: Comprehensive user profile display
- `ActivityFeed`: Real-time community activity stream

## Multi-User Patterns

### Task Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: User creates task with STX escrow
2. **Discovery**: Community members browse available tasks
3. **Application**: Users apply for tasks with messages
4. **Assignment**: Creator assigns task to chosen applicant
5. **Completion**: Assignee marks task complete
6. **Payment**: STX automatically released from escrow

### Permission System
- **Task Creators**: Can assign, approve completion, manage their tasks
- **Task Assignees**: Can complete assigned tasks, communicate with creators
- **Community Members**: Can browse, apply for, and discover tasks
- **Profile Owners**: Full control over their profiles and privacy settings

## Advanced Features

### Real-Time State Management
- Parallel contract data loading for performance
- Optimistic UI updates with blockchain confirmation
- Automatic conflict resolution for concurrent updates
- Background refresh for community activity

### Reputation System
- Task completion tracking and scoring
- Community contribution metrics
- Skill-based reputation calculation
- Badge and achievement system

### Transaction Management
- Complex multi-step transaction flows
- Transaction monitoring with retry logic
- User-friendly progress indicators
- Error recovery and rollback mechanisms
